# Breadth-First-Search-BFS

**Description**
This is a simple implementation of the Breadth-First Search algorithm in Python. BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the current depth before moving to vertices at the next depth level.

**Features**
Uses adjacency list representation (dictionary) for the graph
Implements BFS using a queue (deque) for efficient operations
Handles cyclic graphs using visited nodes tracking
Returns the traversal order of nodes

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
collections.deque
